# Introduction
Mchezopesa Ltd needed football analysis consultation to predict the result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in  training).

# Project Overview(Description)

I am set to predict the result between team 1 and team 2 based on who's home and who's away and on whether or not the game is friendly.(Rank should be included in the training)Using the polynomial approach, I should predict how many goals the home team scores using model 1 and predict how many goals the away team scores using model 2.
I also need to use the Logistic approach to figure out from the home teams perspective if a game is a win, lose or a draw.

# Recording the Experimental Design

1.) Approach 1: Polynomial approach

a)What to train given:

Rank of home team

Rank of away team

b)Tournament type

Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.

Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.

2.) Approach 2: Logistic approach

Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home teamâ€™s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)
